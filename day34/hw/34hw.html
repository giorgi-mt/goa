It investigates various types of knowledge, including theoretical and practical knowledge, and related concepts, such as belief, truth, and justification. Epistemologists distinguish different sources of knowledge, ranging from perception and introspection to memory, reason, and testimony. The schools of skepticism and fallibilism question the existence and certainty of knowledge, while empiricism and rationalism debate whether all knowledge stems from sense experience. Theories discussing the nature and role of justification include foundationalism, coherentism, internalism, and externalism. Separate branches of epistemology focus on knowledge in specific fields, such as scientific, mathematical, moral, and religious knowledge. Other branches are characterized by the aspects of knowledge they investigate or the research methodologies they use. Early reflections on the nature, sources, and scope of knowledge are found in ancient Greek, Indian, and Chinese philosophy. (Full article...)
